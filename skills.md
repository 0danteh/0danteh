Really interested huh xd, aight here's the breakdown (not following any order)

You will find the following categories: **Science**, **CS (dev)** and **Cybersecurity**

### Science

- Mathematics (mastered almost every mathematical fields, from calculus to multi-dimensional chaotic algebraical topologies)
- Physics (mastered almost every physics-related fields as well, from basic classical mechanics to quantum physics and quantum chemistry)
- Chemistry & Biochemistry (with specific attention to organic chemistry and neural biochemistry)

### CS (dev)

- Artificial Intelligence (development of algorithms and anything related)
